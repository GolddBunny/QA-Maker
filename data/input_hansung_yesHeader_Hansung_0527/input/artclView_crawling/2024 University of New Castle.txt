Title: 2024 University of New CastleURL Source: https://hansung.ac.kr/bbs/international/642/265562/artclView.do## 메타데이터작성일: 2024.12.19작성자: 국제교류지원팀Markdown Content:Maddie Huynh (University of New Castle, Australia)As I gather my thoughts and reflect on the time that I have spent at Hansung International Summer School, a wave of emotions washes over me as I realise that the bittersweet farewell is just around the corner. Before I begin my reflection, I would like to give my sincere gratitude towards our summer father in HISS 2024, Director Kim, and his devoted assistants, Youngjin and Jinju. Their unwavering dedication and tireless efforts have truly made this summer an unforgettable experience for all of us. Director Kim's leadership and vision, combined with the hard work and support of Youngjin and Jinju, ensured that every aspect of the program was meticulously planned and executed. Their commitment to providing us with the best possible experience is deeply appreciated, and I am immensely thankful for everything they have done to make this summer extraordinary.Driven by a passion and heartfelt love for Korean culture, particularly K-pop and K-dramas, I decided to participate in a summer program in Seoul, even though my home school does not have any partner universities in South Korea. After thoroughly researching various summer programs in Seoul, I stumbled upon Hansung University's website. The first thing that caught my eye was the well-balanced itinerary, which seamlessly integrated academic classes and cultural activities. The diverse range of cultural activities was particularly appealing, as they were thoughtfully incorporated into the program to provide a holistic and immersive experience. Initially, reaching out to Hansung University without any assistance from my home school was quite a daunting experience. The process of independently managing the application and filling out additional credit transfer documents was particularly challenging. However, I am incredibly grateful to Director Kim for his prompt responses and the continuous support he provided through our back-and-forth emails. His guidance made a significant difference. Looking back now, I am glad I persevered and stuck with my decision to participate in the program until the very end.Traveling solo to another country without knowing anyone was a completely new experience for me. Initially, I was apprehensive, but the friendliness and acceptance of everyone I met quickly put me at ease. This warm and welcoming environment made it easy for me to reach out and make new friends. Meeting people from diverse cultural backgrounds and various parts of the world was truly fascinating, enriching my experience and broadening my understanding of global perspectives. From Scotland, UK to America and Canada, everyone brought unique perspectives on life and refreshing attitudes towards this program. This journey not only allowed me to explore a new country but also to connect with a vibrant, multicultural community.My first impression of Seoul was that it was a magnificent and bustle city filled with hilly streets, where the rich history seamlessly blends in with cutting-edge modernity. As I walked through the some of Seoul’s busiest streets such as Meyongdong and Hongdae for the first time in the first week, I was greeted by a skyline punctuated with towering skyscrapers, followed by hallways of street vendors and high-end shopping. The youthful energy, indie music scene and quirky cafes continued to fill the air from day to night, and it was something I could not see often at home. The city’s public transportation system, efficient and extensive, makes exploring its many neighbourhoods convenient and enjoyable. On our first subway trip, we encountered a minor inconvenience when we misread the directions on NaverMap and ended up getting lost in the subway system. Confusion and a bit of panic set in as we tried to navigate the labyrinthine stations, struggling to understand the signs and maps around us. Just when we were feeling utterly lost, a kind stranger stepped in to help. Despite the language barrier, this capeless hero communicated through gestures and a warm smile, guiding us to the right platform and ensuring we were on the correct train. His generosity and patience turned a potentially stressful situation into a memorable encounter, highlighting the kindness and helpfulness of the people we met during our time in Seoul.The following week marked our first official full week at school. After attending our language and cultural classes, we eagerly participated in the afternoon activities, filled with anticipation and excitement. Among these, one of my favorite cultural experiences was the "Explore Downtown" walk. This activity included a delightful visit to several iconic sites: the charming Bukchon Hanok Village, where traditional Korean houses offer a glimpse into the past; the historic Gwanghwamun Square, with its grand statues and proximity to the majestic Gyeongbokgung Palace; the serene Jogyesa Temple, a peaceful sanctuary in the heart of the city; and finally, the bustling Insadong, renowned for its vibrant atmosphere, artisan shops, and traditional tea houses. This excursion not only provided a deeper appreciation of Seoul's rich history and culture but also allowed us to experience the city's unique blend of old and new.Another of my favourite cultural activities was attending a baseball game between the LG Twins and the SSG Landers. It was my first time watching a live sporting event, and my excitement was palpable. In anticipation of the game, I even bought one of the team’s baseball jerseys beforehand, and had Oh Ji-hwan on the back of my jersey. The energy in the stadium was electrifying, with everyone buzzing with excitement before the game started. As the game progressed, the atmosphere only grew more intense. The crowd's enthusiasm was infectious, with chants, cheers, and songs filling the air. The highlight of the game came when there were two consecutive home runs. Number 10, Oh Ji-hwan, and number 55, Kim Beom-seok, each hit spectacular home runs, sending the crowd into a frenzy. This thrilling moment captured the spirit and excitement of Korean baseball, making it an unforgettable experience that I will cherish forever. The game ended with LG Twins winning the game with a 12-9. Through this experience, I discovered my love for baseball, and I will definitely come back to support the LG Twins.Another highlight of this summer program was the two-day excursion to Pyeongchang and Gangneung, which I thoroughly enjoyed. I appreciated the well-organized schedule, which allowed us to explore various facets of the picturesque countryside. On the first day, we delved into Korea’s rich history and culture. We began with a visit to Ojukheon House, the birthplace of the renowned scholar Yi I, who is featured on the South Korean 5,000 won bill. Walking through his historic home provided fascinating insights into his life and contributions to Korean intellectual history. We then proceeded to the Pyeongchang Olympic Museum, where we learned about the significant milestones of the Winter Olympics and the unique moment when athletes from North and South Korea competed together. This museum visit not only highlighted the sporting achievements but also underscored the spirit of unity and collaboration that transcends political boundaries. After checking into the family hotel, a group of friends and myself went on a walk around the neighbourhoods, where we discovered a small western village and the Olympic statue. The following day, we had the chance to visit a sheep ranch, the Gangwon Hyuhyuam Hermitage, and Yeonggeumjeong. This trip was a wonderful mix of cultural experiences and historical exploration, deepening my appreciation of Korean heritage and showcasing the significance of preserving cultural traditions.During my time in South Korea, I fully immersed myself in exploring the rich and diverse world of Korean cuisine. Contrary to my initial expectations, I discovered that I enjoyed some Korean dishes more than others. While Korean BBQ and Chimaek (a popular combination of fried chicken and beer) were certainly enjoyable, they didn't quite capture my palate the way I had anticipated. Instead, I found myself gravitating towards the comforting and flavorful world of Korean stews. Among the various options, I particularly developed a fondness for Budae Jjigae and Kimchi Jjigae. Budae Jjigae, with its hearty mix of ingredients like sausage, tofu, and vegetables simmered in a spicy broth, offered a satisfying blend of flavors and textures. Kimchi Jjigae, on the other hand, provided a warm, spicy kick with its robust kimchi base, combined with pork and tofu. These stews not only delighted my taste buds but also provided a comforting sense of home away from home, making them my standout favourites during my culinary journey in South Korea.As I reflect on my experiences as an international student in the summer course in South Korea, I am filled with a profound sense of gratitude and fulfillment. This journey has been more than just an academic endeavour; it has been a transformative adventure that has enriched my understanding of Korean culture and broadened my global perspective. From navigating the vibrant streets of Seoul and delving into its culinary delights to exploring historic landmarks and engaging with the local community, every moment has contributed to a deeper appreciation of this fascinating country. This summer has not only enhanced my academic and cultural knowledge but also fostered personal growth and resilience. The friendships I’ve made, the challenges I’ve overcome, and the insights I’ve gained will undoubtedly influence my future endeavours. As I conclude this chapter, I carry with me a wealth of cherished memories and a renewed sense of curiosity and appreciation for the diverse world we live in.
