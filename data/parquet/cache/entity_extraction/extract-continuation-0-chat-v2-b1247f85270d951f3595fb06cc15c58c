서초구\n양재aT센터에서 중앙일보와 가진 단독 인터뷰에서 이 같이 말했다. “AI가\n사람보다 우월한 결정을 내릴 미래에 대해 어떻게 대비해야 하냐”는 질문\n에 대한 답이다. 그는 분명 AI가 똑똑해지고 있지만 최종 결정권은 인간에\n게 있다고 강조했다.\n입력 2025.03.27 05:00 업데이트 2025.03.27

아니지만\nMS를 재창업 수준으로 바꾼 ‘리파운더’(refounder·재창업자)로 불린다. 윈\n도(Window), 오피스 중심의 오래된 회사 MS를 클라우드 서비스 중심으로\n재편하면서 AI 시대 리더가 될 발판을 만들어서다. 소셜미디어 링크드인과\n개발 코드 공유 플랫폼 깃허브 인수, 생성 AI 선두주자 오픈AI에 대한 투자\n모두 그의 결정으로 이뤄졌다. 2014년 3000억 달러(약 439조 원)였던 MS\n의 기업가치는 현재 3조 달러(약 4391조 원)에 육박한다.\n사티아 나델라 마이크로소프트 최고경영자(CEO)가 26일 오후 서울 서초구 양재aT센터에서 중앙일보와 만나 인터뷰했다. 그는 AI\n에이전트의 발전 방향, 반도체 전략, 한국 기업들과의 협력 등에 대해 언급했다. 사진
