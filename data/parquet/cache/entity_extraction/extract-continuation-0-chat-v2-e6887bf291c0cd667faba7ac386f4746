MS가 AI 칩 생태계를 구축하\n는 과정에서 삼성전자, SK하이닉스 등 한국 기업들과 어떤 역할 분담을 할\n수 있나.\nMS가 자체 개발한 AI 칩 ‘코발트’의 패키징을 한국 회사에서 하는 것으로\n안다. 이보다 더 심층적인 협력도 가능한가.\nKT나 LG 등 다른 한국 기업과도 협업 중인데. 이들과 파트너십을 평가한\n다면.\n한국 반도체 산업은 MS 뿐 아니라 전 세계적으로도 중요하다. AI가 점점\n더 발전하면서, 사람들이 ‘이 칩이 빠르냐 느리냐’만 따지던 시대는 이제\n갔다. (인프라 비용이 점점 증가하는) AI 시대에는 ‘성능 대비 비용과 전\n력 효율’이 중요하다. 즉 ‘달러당, 와트당 얼마나 좋은 성능을 낼 수 있\n냐’가 AI 시대의 새로운 기준이다. 한국이 가진 기술력, 특히 메모리 반도\n체 분야는 이미 세계 최고 수준이고, 이런 기술들이 향후 AI의 성능을 끌\n어올려 줄 수 있는 핵심이라고 생각한다.\n이미 삼성전자나 SK하이닉스와 프로젝트들을 진행 중이다. 이는 MS의\n핵심 기술 개발과 직결되는 중요한 작업들이다.\n25. 3. 27. 오전 10:23\n[단독] MS 10배 키운 나델라 장담 \"AI판 뒤집을 대혁신 온다\" | 중앙일보\nhttps://www.joongang.co.kr/article/25323870\n3/7\n\n이날 조주완 LG전자 CEO는 나델라 CEO와 인공지능(AI) 사업 관련 전략적\n기술 협력 방안을 논의한 뒤 자신의 소셜미디어에 “양사는 AI 에이전트 공\n동 개발과 AI 데이터센터 협업, 인도 시장에서 협력 가능성을 논의했다”고\n밝혔다. 특히 조 CEO는 “MS 데이터센터에 LG전자의 냉각 솔루션을 제공\n하기로 합의했다”며 “LG에너지솔루션의 무정전 전원공급장치(UPS)와 LG\nCNS의 운영 전문성 등 LG 계열사와의 협업 가능성도 논의했다”고 밝혔다.\n지금처럼 AI가 빠르게 확산되는 상황에서, 기술을 갖고 있는 것과 실제 일\n상에 적용하는건 또 다른 얘기인 것 같다. 한국 시장은 어떻게 평가하나.\nMS는 AI 산업 선두주자다.지금 어떤 부분을 중요하게 보고 있나.\n이들과의 협업은 MS가 공동 혁신(joint innovation)을 어떻게 바라보고\n있는지 잘 보여주는 사례라고 생각한다. KT와는 한국의 규제 환경 내에\n서도 사용할 수 있을 만큼 신뢰도 높은 클라우드 환경을 만들고 있다.
