LG와의 협력도 굉장히 흥미롭다. 우리 AI 기술을 활용해 로봇 시\n스템을 개발하고 있는데, 여기에 자체 기술을 결합해 새로운 형태의 ‘홈\n허브’ 제품을 만들고 있다. 그리고 미국 뿐 아니라 글로벌 시장을 겨냥하\n고 있다. 단순한 기술 적용을 넘어, 시장을 함께 설계하고 글로벌 기회를\n확장해가는 과정이 지금 MS가 중요하게 생각하는 협력 방식이다.\nAI 이전 큰 혁신이었던 모바일이나 클라우드 기술은 본질적으로 무언가\n를 소비하는 데 초점이 맞춰져 있었다. 대부분의 사람들이 그 기술을 통\n해 더 많은 콘텐트를 보고, 서비스를 이용하고, 정보를 받는 쪽에 집중했\n다. 하지만 AI는 이와 달리 사람들이 직접 무언가를 ‘만드는’ 기술이다.\n그래서 지금 시대엔 AI를 누가 가장 잘 만들었느냐보다, 누가 더 빠르게,\n더 많이 직접 활용하고 있냐가 경쟁력을 가를 거라고 본다.\nAI를 통해 진짜 경제적 성장을 만들어낼 수 있냐는 문제에 집중하고 있\n다. 예를 들어, 선진국의 경우 AI를 활용해서 국가 전체의 경제 생산성을\n두 배, 세 배로 끌어올릴 수 있을까? 그리고 그로 인해 모든 사람이 혜택\n25. 3. 27. 오전 10:23\n[단독] MS 10배 키운 나델라 장담 \"AI판 뒤집을 대혁신 온다\" | 중앙일보\nhttps://www.joongang.co.kr/article/25323870\n4/7\n\n실제 그는 이날 행사 기조연설(키노트)에서 “코파일럿(MS의 AI 에이전트\n서비스)은 AI 시대 새로운 사용자 인터페이스(UI)\"라고 말했다. 앞으로는\n코파일럿이 브라우저나 앱처럼 AI와 사람을 연결해주는 ‘대화형 운영 체\n제’로 자리매김하게 될 것이라는 의미다. 기존에는 필요한 서비스가 있으\n면 일일이 앱을 켜거나 인터넷 브라우저를 열고 접속해야 했지만, 이제는\n코파일럿을 통해 한 번의 명령만으로도 원하는 작업을 처리할 수 있게 됐\n다.\n을 받을 수 있을까? 그게 우리가 스스로에게 던지고 있는 질문이다. 기술\n만 발전시키는 건 한계가 있다.
