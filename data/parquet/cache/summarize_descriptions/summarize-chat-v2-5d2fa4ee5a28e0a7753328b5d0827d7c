{"result": "The entities \"SYSTEM MODULARIZATION\" and \"SYSTEM COMPLEXITY REDUCTION\" are closely related concepts. Modularization is a process that involves breaking down a system into smaller units, which in turn helps reduce the overall complexity of the system. By breaking the system into manageable units, it becomes easier to understand and maintain. Therefore, modularization plays a key role in reducing system complexity and improving overall system efficiency.", "input": "\nYou are a helpful assistant responsible for generating a comprehensive summary of the data provided below.\nGiven one or two entities, and a list of descriptions, all related to the same entity or group of entities.\nPlease concatenate all of these into a single, comprehensive description.
